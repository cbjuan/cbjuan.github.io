Some research projects claim that they can generate text that can be interpreted as human writing, enabling new possibilities in many application areas. Among the different areas related to language processing, one of the most notable in applying this type of modeling is programming languages. For years, the machine learning community has been researching this software engineering area, pursuing goals like applying different approaches to auto-complete, generate, fix, or evaluate code programmed by humans. Considering the increasing popularity of the deep learning-enabled language models approach, we found a lack of empirical papers that compare different deep learning architectures to create and use language models based on programming code. This paper compares different neural network architectures like Average Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD) Weight-Dropped LSTMs (AWD-LSTMs), AWD-Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs), and Transformer while using transfer learning and different forms of tokenization to see how they behave in building language models using a Python dataset for code generation and filling mask tasks. Considering the results, we discuss each approach's different strengths and weaknesses and what gaps we found to evaluate the language models or to apply them in a real programming context.","tags":["Computation and Language","Machine Learning","Programming Languages","Software Engineering"],"title":"Automated Source Code Generation and Auto-Completion Using Deep Learning: Comparing and Discussing Current Language Model-Related Approaches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["José Carlos Sánchez-Prieto","Juan Cruz-Benito","Roberto Therón","Francisco J.

The shift of traditional learning procedures into more online and tech-ish approaches has contributed to a context that can favor integrating Artificial-Intelligence-based or algorithm-based assessment of learning. Even more, with the current acceleration because of the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more learning processes are becoming online and are incorporating technologies related to automatize assessment or help instructors in the process. While we are in an initial stage of that integration, it is the moment to reflect on the students' perceptions of being assessed by a non-conscious software entity like a machine learning model or any other artificial intelligence application. As a result of the paper, we present a TAM-based model and a ready-to-use instrument based on five aspects concerning understanding technology adoption like the AI-based assessment on education. These aspects are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards use, behavioral intention, and actual use. The paper's outcomes can be relevant to the research community since there is a lack of this kind of proposal in the literature.","tags":["Artificial Intelligence","e-assessment","Adoption"],"title":"Assessed by Machines: Development of a TAM-Based Tool to Measure AI-based Assessment Acceptance Among Students","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

That question fired a research and engineering process at the core of the IBM Quantum cloud software team to provision, and integrate with our software, a JupyterHub deployment on Kubernetes available for ~240000 enrolled users. In this talk, we discuss how we have integrated JupyterHub with our already existing IBM Quantum Experience platform and how we are leveraging the power of the JupyterHub to provide the best experience to the users. Among other aspects, during the presentation, we cover how we have solved, and we're still addressing issues related to custom authentication with our platform, performance, look \u0026 feel, permanent storage per user, user environment tailoring, provision of pre-installed software like Qiskit (https://qiskit.org/) and other quantum-related software and tutorials, automation of the selection of custom hardware resources for different users, how we deal with malicious users, or how we handle ~800 concurrent user servers during our last May 4th challenge (https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2020/05/quantum-challenge-results/).

One of the activities in which it is beginning to be implemented is the assessment of student achievement. This way, we can find in the literature an increasing number of investigations focused on the possibilities offered by the adoption of AI-driven assessment. However, the use of AI is also a source of concern that raises suspicions in some sectors of our society. In this context, knowing the position of the teachers towards this topic is critical to guarantee the successful development of the field. This paper intends to fill a research gap in the literature by offering a technology adoption model based on TAM to study the factors that condition the use of AI-driven assessment among teachers. To present this model we offer a background on the use of AI in education and the technology acceptance among teachers, as well as the definition of the eight constructs and the relational hypotheses included. Finally, the possibilities of the model and future lines of research are discussed.","tags":["Artificial intelligence","Education","Teachers","Technology acceptance model","eLearning"],"title":"How to Measure Teachers' Acceptance of AI-driven Assessment in eLearning: A TAM-based Proposal","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

It is applied in many different contexts successfully. One of the contexts where Artificial Intelligence is applied is in Education. In the literature, we find several works in the last years that explore the application of Artificial Intelligence-related techniques to analyze students’ behavior, to enable virtual tutors or to assess the learning. However, what are the students’ perceptions on this subject of Artificial Intelligence and Education? Do they accept the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques to assess their learning? Are they reluctant to be influenced by non-human agents in such a human process like education? To try to respond to these questions, this paper presents a novel proposal of a research model based on the Technology Acceptance Model. To describe the model, we present its different main constructs and variables, as well as the hypotheses to analyze, adapted to the object of study. Finally, we discuss the main implications of this research model, the opportunities that could come based on this proposal and the future of this research.","tags":["Artificial intelligence","Technology acceptance model","Education","eLearning","Students"],"title":"Measuring Students’ Acceptance to AI-Driven Assessment in eLearning: Proposing a First TAM-Based Research Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Cruz-Benito","Francisco J.

Many studies include these approaches in different research areas: from research in healthcare to mobile environments, robotics, etc. Interaction is seen as a critical concept, and the work for its improvement is a crucial factor for many platforms, systems, and business domains. The goal of this manuscript is to present a systematic review of the literature to identify, analyze and classify the published approaches to support or enhance Human-Computer Interaction or Human-Machine Interaction from the perspective of software architectures. The method followed is the systematic review following the guidelines related to Systematic Literature Reviews methods such as the one proposed by Kitchenham and other authors in the field of software engineering. As results, this study identified 39 papers that included software architectures to improve or analyze Human-Computer Interaction or Human-Machine Interaction. Three main approaches were found on software architectures: layered architectures, modular architectures, and architectures based on software agents, but they lacked standardization and were mainly ad-hoc solutions. The primary interfaces covered were those related to Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and multimodal/natural ones. The primary application domain detected were in multimodal systems. The main purpose of most of the papers was to support multimodal interaction. Some conclusions achieved are that the generic solutions to support or analyze HCI/HMI processes are still rare in the literature. Despite many works dealing with this topic and its issues and challenges, it is necessary to keep on improving the research in this area through the application of standard techniques and solutions, exploring new ways of analyzing and interpreting interaction, escaping from ad-hoc solutions or evaluating the solutions proposed.","tags":["Human-Computer Interaction","Human-Machine Interaction","Software Architectures","Systematic Literature Review"],"title":"Analyzing the software architectures supporting HCI/HMI processes through a systematic review of the literature","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Despite that, they present an evident learning curve that could be hard for regular developers and newcomers in the field of quantum computing. On the other hand, currently there are many ways to build intelligent systems that can learn from humans and processes to build a knowledge corpus and provide a different kind of help to humans in tasks like aiding in decision making processes, recommending multimedia resources, building conversational agents, etc. In this paper we describe a work-in-progress project developed by the IBM Q team that implements an intelligent system based on a deep learning approach that learns how people code using the Open QASM language to later offer help and guidance to the coders by recommending different code sequences, logical steps or even small pieces of code. During the paper, we describe our current approach and first results. They include the use of seq2seq neural networks that effectively learn quantum-code sequences, and which will be tested in real context in the near future to improve the user experience in IBM Q Experience products.","tags":[],"title":"A Deep-Learning-Based Proposal to Aid Users in Quantum Computing Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

En el nuevo paradigma educativo, las competencias se han convertido en la referencia a partir de la cual se organiza, planifica y evalúa el aprendizaje, y las agencias de calidad encargadas de evaluar los planes de estudio han introducido nuevos criterios ligados a la empleabilidad y la inserción laboral. Sin embargo, en España la información sobre muchos de estos temas es insuficiente, especialmente en cuanto a las competencias que se necesitan a lo largo de la vida laboral y la aportación de la universidad en su adquisición, los factores que determinan el acceso al empleo y la estabilidad laboral, la satisfacción con el trabajo y con la formación recibida, la idoneidad de las metodologías educativas utilizadas, o los desajustes entre la educación y el empleo.

To explain visual literacy and its implications, the theoretical background about the visual literacy research field is presented first. Then, also within the section on background, the chapter presents the main concepts related to culture, and how it and visual literacy can be analyzed together to enable cross-cultural analysis. To conduct these cross-cultural analyses, this chapter proposes a new kind of quantitative questionnaire-based instrument that includes a section to measure the cultural characteristics of the individual and their level of literacy.

Such adaptability is based on the application of machine-learning procedures and an A/B testing approach. To detect the user preferences, behavior, and the optimal version of the forms for all kinds of users, researchers built predictive models using machine-learning algorithms (trained with data from more than 3000 users who participated previously in the questionnaires), extracting the most relevant factors that describe the models, and clustering the users based on their similar characteristics and these factors. Based on these groups and their performance in the system, the researchers generated heuristic rules between the different versions of the web forms to guide users to the most adequate version (modifying the user interface and user experience) for them. To validate the approach and confirm the improvements, the authors tested these redirection rules on a group of more than 1000 users. The results with this cohort of users were better than those achieved without redirection rules at the initial stage. Besides these promising results, the paper proposes a future study that would enhance the process (or automate it) as well as push its application to other fields.","tags":["human factors","learning (artificial intelligence)","user interfaces","enabling adaptability","user characteristics detection","machine learning","original study","questionnaires","machine-learning procedures","A/B testing approach","user preferences","optimal version","predictive models","machine-learning algorithms","relevant factors","similar characteristics","different versions","adequate version","user interface","user experience","redirection rules","Web forms","user behavior","heuristic rules","Predictive models","Testing","Employment","Tools","Machine learning algorithms","Software","Electronic mail","Adaptability","machine learning","user profiles","web forms","clusters","hierarchical clustering","random forest","A/B testing","human-computer interaction","HCI"],"title":"Enabling Adaptability in Web Forms Based on User Characteristics Detection Through A/B Testing and Machine Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Vázquez-Ingelmo","Juan Cruz-Benito","Francisco J.

To manage these data flows, data-driven ecosystems need high levels of interoperability, as it allows the collaboration and independence of both internal and external components. REST APIs are a common solution to achieve interoperability, but sometimes they lack flexibility and performance. The arising of GraphQL APIs as a flexible, fast and stable protocol for data fetching makes it an interesting approach for data-intensive and complex data-driven (eco)systems. This paper outlines the GraphQL protocol and the benefits derived from its use, as well as it presents a case of study of the improvement experienced by the Observatory of Employment and Employability (also known as OEEU) ecosystem after including GraphQL as main API in several components. The results of the paper show promising improvements regarding the flexibility, maintainability and performance, among other benefits.","tags":null,"title":"Improving the OEEU's data-driven technological ecosystem's interoperability with GraphQL","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Interview"],"content":"","date":1499900400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600704624,"objectID":"d0079f4437d715961df8e9ba2825a5d2","permalink":"https://cbjuan.github.io/media/2017-tlp-innova/","publishdate":"2017-07-13T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/media/2017-tlp-innova/","section":"media","summary":"[ES] Interview published in the [TLP Tenerife's website](https://tlp-tenerife.com/) about my trajectory and the talk I was going to give in TLP Innova 2017","tags":["media"],"title":"Jul 13, 2017. \"La informática es un arma poderosa para enseñar a la gente\"","type":"media"},{"authors":["Juan Cruz-Benito","Francisco J.

In our case, the large survey is a questionnaire produced by the Spanish Observatory for University Employability and Employment (OEEU in the Spanish acronym). This questionnaire is composed by around 32 and 60 questions and between 86 and 181 variables to be measured. The research is based on the previous experience of a past questionnaire proposed by the OEEU composed also by a large amount of questions and variables to be measured (63–92 questions and 176–279 variables). After analyzing the target population of the questionnaire (with the target population of the previous questionnaire as reference) and reviewing the literature, we have designed 11 proposals for changes in the questionnaire that could improve users’ completion and success ratios (changes that could improve the users’ trust in the questionnaire, the questionnaire usability and user experience or the users’ engagement to the questionnaire). These changes are planned to be applied in the questionnaire in two main different experiments based on A/B test methodologies that will allow researchers to measure the effect of the changes in different populations and in an incremental way. The proposed changes have been assessed by five experts through an evaluation questionnaire. In this questionnaire, researchers gathered the score of each expert regarding to the pertinence, relevance and clarity of each change proposed. Regarding the results of this evaluation questionnaire, the reviewers fully supported 8 out of the 11 changes proposals, so they could be introduced in the questionnaire with no variation. On the other hand, 3 of the proposed changes or improvements are not fully supported by the experts (they have not received a score in the top first quartile of the 1–7 Likert scale). These changes will not be discarded immediately, because despite they have not received a Q1 score, they received a score within the second quartile, so could be reviewed to be enhanced to fit the OEEU’s context.","tags":null,"title":"Improving success/completion ratio in large surveys: a proposal based on usability and engagement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Cruz-Benito"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1478559600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544725048,"objectID":"d88163dd2788ac07801616f8ca5fd104","permalink":"https://cbjuan.github.io/publication/2016_juancruz-benito/","publishdate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_juancruz-benito/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Systematic Literature Review \u0026 Mapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco J.

This is very costly and unusual in universities. Virtual 3D worlds allow simulating immersive professional contexts for training. The first aim of this project is to design and construct a virtual analytical laboratory adapted to good laboratory practices (GLP) in the Second Lifetexttrademark (SL) virtual world. The second aim is to set up a practice based on the inspection of the virtual laboratory installations. Finally, the students' acquisition of knowledge and satisfaction were assessed. The laboratory is available online on the Usalpharma Island of SL. The installations, equipment and tools were created using SL's building tools. During two academic years, a total of 30 students made an inspection of the laboratory to identify and classify nonconformities of a GLP quality system (supplementary video). They report the results in an assessment report. The following evaluation of the practice shows that the scores concerning the assessment of skills (7.1 textpm 0.5 out of 10) and knowledge acquired (7.8 textpm 0.3 out of 10) met the expectations of the authors. In an anonymous questionnaire, 81 % of the students assessed the experiment as satisfactory. The virtual laboratory allows, at very low cost, training postgraduate students in facilities not available at university. Tools like this could be implemented not only at universities, but in professional field in order to assess competencies or support the essential lifelong learning of the laboratory staff.","tags":null,"title":"Facility-based inspection training in a virtual 3D laboratory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco J.
