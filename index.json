It\u0026rsquo;s an elegant insight from the 1960s—and surprisingly relevant to where AI is headed.\nMany researchers have explored formal verification, type-driven development, and reasoning-based generation in AI. But Curry–Howard offers something more: a conceptual framework for understanding what\u0026rsquo;s missing in current LLMs and what becomes possible if we push further.\nThe gap is narrowing. We\u0026rsquo;re already seeing glimpses of this future: reasoning models that decompose problems step-by-step, agents that iterate and verify their outputs, post-training techniques that reward logical consistency over mere plausibility. But these are still fundamentally pattern-matching systems with reasoning-like behavior grafted on. Curry–Howard suggests a more fundamental shift—one where programs are proofs and types are logical propositions about correctness.\nWhat would the next leap look like? Programs as proofs in scientific computing. Imagine an LLM generating not just a quantum circuit in Qiskit, but a circuit with accompanying correctness guarantees—proving it implements the intended algorithm, respects hardware constraints, or satisfies specific properties. In science and quantum computing, this means code we can trust, not just code that runs and passes tests.\nTypes as reasoning scaffolds. Dependently-typed languages like Coq or Lean already embody Curry–Howard: types express logical specifications, and programs that type-check are valid proofs. Current LLMs can generate code in these languages, but they don\u0026rsquo;t truly reason within them. The next generation should navigate proof spaces natively, generating solutions that are provably correct by construction, not by post-hoc verification.\nAI as a verification partner. In quantum computing, bugs aren\u0026rsquo;t just inconvenient—they\u0026rsquo;re catastrophic. A misconfigured gate sequence, an incorrect assumption about decoherence, and months of experimental time are wasted. Today\u0026rsquo;s coding agents can catch some errors through testing and iteration. Tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s should provide formal guarantees.\nThe challenge ahead The challenge is architectural: current approaches layer reasoning on top of statistical foundations. What we need are systems where formal reasoning is intrinsic—models that learn not just to predict tokens, but to construct and verify proofs, where the training objective itself rewards logical soundness.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t distant future. Research on neural theorem proving, program synthesis with specifications, and LLMs integrated with proof assistants is accelerating. What Curry–Howard offers is a north star: a vision of AI that doesn\u0026rsquo;t just mimic reasoning, but embodies it.\nFor fields like quantum computing, and science in general, where correctness is non-negotiable, this evolution from reasoning-flavored generation to proof-native systems could be transformative.\nNote: The featured image for this post was generated using Gemini Nano Banana.\n","date":1764633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1764686298,"objectID":"d322d085a579caf19b26a599b1e4633b","permalink":"https://cbjuan.github.io/post/2025-curry-howard-ai/","publishdate":"2025-12-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2025-curry-howard-ai/","section":"post","summary":"The Curry–Howard correspondence—propositions as types, proofs as programs—offers a conceptual framework for understanding what's missing in current LLMs and what becomes possible when AI systems learn to construct and verify proofs natively.","tags":["AI","Formal Verification","LLMs","Quantum Computing","Proof Assistants"],"title":"Seeing AI Through the Curry–Howard Lens","type":"post"},{"authors":["Juan Cruz-Benito"],"categories":["Quantum Computing","Artificial Intelligence","Open Source"],"content":"We\u0026rsquo;ve upgraded the Qiskit Code Assistant! 🚀\nLast month, we introduced mistral-small-3.2-24b-qiskit, replacing granite-3.3-8b-qiskit.\nKey Improvements ✅ Better accuracy: The new model ranks higher across key benchmarks, including QiskitHumanEval, QiskitHumanEval Hard, HumanEval, MathQA, ASDiv, SciQ and others (see the model card for more info).\n✅ Improved UX: More precise responses for quantum programming tasks.\n✅ Open access: Available on Hugging Face → https://huggingface.co/Qiskit/mistral-small-3.2-24b-qiskit.\nThis update is part of our mission to make quantum development more intuitive and efficient. 🌟\nExplore it, test it, and share your feedback!\n#Qiskit #QuantumComputing #AI #OpenSource #HuggingFace\nOriginally shared on LinkedIn on November 27, 2025\n","date":1764201600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1768586627,"objectID":"0b8c65c339fdedd712be1d562f05ee52","permalink":"https://cbjuan.github.io/post/2025-mistral-qiskit-code-assistant-upgrade/","publishdate":"2025-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2025-mistral-qiskit-code-assistant-upgrade/","section":"post","summary":"We've upgraded the Qiskit Code Assistant!

Our approach uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to achieve near-optimal synthesis of permutation circuits up to 25 qubits. Rather than developing specialized models for individual topologies, we train a foundational model on a generic rectangular lattice, and employ masking mechanisms to dynamically select subsets of topologies during the synthesis. This enables the synthesis of permutation circuits on any topology that can be embedded within the rectangular lattice, without the need to re-train the model. In this paper we show results for 5x5 lattice and compare them to previous AI topology-oriented models and classical methods, showing that they outperform classical heuristics, and match previous specialized AI models, and performs synthesis even for topologies that were not seen during training. We further show that the model can be fine tuned to strengthen the performance for selected topologies of interest. This methodology allows a single trained model to efficiently synthesize circuits across diverse topologies, allowing its practical integration into transpilation workflows.","tags":["Quantum Computing","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Reinforcement Learning","Circuit Synthesis","Permutation Circuit"],"title":"AI Methods for Permutation Circuit Synthesis Across Generic Topologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Cruz-Benito"],"categories":["Quantum Computing","AI for Quantum","Software Development"],"content":"🚀 🚀🚀 Climbing the ranks in quantum software!\nI\u0026rsquo;m thrilled to share that the qiskit-ibm-transpiler library has moved up to #3 in the Unitary Foundation 2025 Survey under Full-stack development platforms, compilers, and simulators.

The intersection of AI and quantum computing continues to offer compelling research opportunities.\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20907\n#QuantumComputing #AI #MachineLearning #Qiskit #Research #AIforQuantum\nOriginally shared on LinkedIn on August 30, 2025 - 76 reactions, 0 comments as of 11/12/2025\n","date":1756512000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1762943545,"objectID":"c3b7231320d33791a6da06a263ac2014","permalink":"https://cbjuan.github.io/post/2025-quantum-verifiable-rewards-qiskit/","publishdate":"2025-08-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2025-quantum-verifiable-rewards-qiskit/","section":"post","summary":"Released a new paper on a novel approach to train AI models that can write better quantum code using Qiskit.

By collapsing each sub-block to a compact representation and then synthesizing it step-by-step through a learned heuristic, we obtain circuits that are both shorter and compliant with hardware connectivity constraints. We find that the method is fast enough and good enough to work as an optimization procedure: in direct comparisons on 6-qubit random Pauli Networks against state-of-the-art heuristic methods, our RL approach yields over 2x reduction in two-qubit gate count, while executing in under 10 milliseconds per circuit. We further integrate the method into a collect-and-re-synthesize pipeline, applied as a Qiskit transpiler pass, where we observe average improvements of 20% in two-qubit gate count and depth, reaching up to 60% for many instances, across the Benchpress benchmark.

We begin by discussing the unique needs of quantum computing programming, which differ significantly from classical programming approaches or languages. A Code LLM specializing in quantum computing requires a foundational understanding of quantum computing and quantum information theory. However, the scarcity of available quantum code examples and the rapidly evolving field, which necessitates continuous dataset updates, present significant challenges. Moreover, we discuss our work on training Code LLMs to produce high-quality quantum code using the Qiskit library. This work includes an examination of the various aspects of the LLMs used for training and the specific training conditions, as well as the results obtained with our current models. To evaluate our models, we have developed a custom benchmark, similar to HumanEval, which includes a set of tests specifically designed for the field of quantum computing programming using Qiskit. Our findings indicate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in quantum computing tasks. We also provide examples of code suggestions, comparing our model to other relevant code LLMs. Finally, we introduce a discussion on the potential benefits of Code LLMs for quantum computing computational scientists, researchers, and practitioners. We also explore various features and future work that could be relevant in this context.","tags":["Code Large Language Models","code LLMs","Qiskit","Quantum Computing"],"title":"Qiskit Code Assistant: Training LLMs for generating Quantum Computing Code","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Cruz-Benito"],"categories":["Professional Development","Quantum Computing","Artificial Intelligence"],"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m happy to share that I\u0026rsquo;m starting a new position at IBM Quantum as the 1st ever AI for Quantum Product Owner!

In the case of next-word prediction, we show how to solve the task for sentences with previously unknown syntactic structures by applying a classical Random Forest machine learning algorithm that classifies the syntactic structure and enables our QNLP algorithm to infer the proper string model.","tags":["Quantum Computing","Quantum Machine Learning","Quantum Natural Language Processing"],"title":"Using Quantum Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Classification and Next-Word Prediction in Sentences Without Fixed Syntactic Structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Cruz-Benito","Iván Durán Martínez","Sanjay Kumar Lalta Prasad Vishwakarma","Sanket Panda","Francisco Jose Martin Fernandez","Ismael Faro Sertage"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1687996800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719618236,"objectID":"2b9b6679b8ac7689c8f8a7f2104aedb6","permalink":"https://cbjuan.github.io/publication/2023-patent_nlprestricted/","publishdate":"2023-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-patent_nlprestricted/","section":"publication","summary":"A method and system determine network based access to restricted systems.

Some research projects claim that they can generate text that can be interpreted as human writing, enabling new possibilities in many application areas. Among the different areas related to language processing, one of the most notable in applying this type of modeling is programming languages. For years, the machine learning community has been researching this software engineering area, pursuing goals like applying different approaches to auto-complete, generate, fix, or evaluate code programmed by humans. Considering the increasing popularity of the deep learning-enabled language models approach, we found a lack of empirical papers that compare different deep learning architectures to create and use language models based on programming code. This paper compares different neural network architectures like Average Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD) Weight-Dropped LSTMs (AWD-LSTMs), AWD-Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs), and Transformer while using transfer learning and different forms of tokenization to see how they behave in building language models using a Python dataset for code generation and filling mask tasks. Considering the results, we discuss each approach's different strengths and weaknesses and what gaps we found to evaluate the language models or to apply them in a real programming context.","tags":["Computation and Language","Machine Learning","Programming Languages","Software Engineering"],"title":"Automated Source Code Generation and Auto-Completion Using Deep Learning: Comparing and Discussing Current Language Model-Related Approaches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["José Carlos Sánchez-Prieto","Juan Cruz-Benito","Roberto Therón","Francisco J.

The shift of traditional learning procedures into more online and tech-ish approaches has contributed to a context that can favor integrating Artificial-Intelligence-based or algorithm-based assessment of learning. Even more, with the current acceleration because of the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more learning processes are becoming online and are incorporating technologies related to automatize assessment or help instructors in the process. While we are in an initial stage of that integration, it is the moment to reflect on the students' perceptions of being assessed by a non-conscious software entity like a machine learning model or any other artificial intelligence application. As a result of the paper, we present a TAM-based model and a ready-to-use instrument based on five aspects concerning understanding technology adoption like the AI-based assessment on education. These aspects are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards use, behavioral intention, and actual use. The paper's outcomes can be relevant to the research community since there is a lack of this kind of proposal in the literature.","tags":["Artificial Intelligence","e-assessment","Adoption"],"title":"Assessed by Machines: Development of a TAM-Based Tool to Measure AI-based Assessment Acceptance Among Students","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1602633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610445880,"objectID":"79579960c6f9baa545c028f7f8e1c88e","permalink":"https://cbjuan.github.io/talk/2020_jupytercon/","publishdate":"2020-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2020_jupytercon/","section":"talk","summary":"How can we enable a complete online experience for IBM’s Quantum Experience (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) users to access all of our quantum devices and software libraries effortlessly?

One of the activities in which it is beginning to be implemented is the assessment of student achievement. This way, we can find in the literature an increasing number of investigations focused on the possibilities offered by the adoption of AI-driven assessment. However, the use of AI is also a source of concern that raises suspicions in some sectors of our society. In this context, knowing the position of the teachers towards this topic is critical to guarantee the successful development of the field. This paper intends to fill a research gap in the literature by offering a technology adoption model based on TAM to study the factors that condition the use of AI-driven assessment among teachers. To present this model we offer a background on the use of AI in education and the technology acceptance among teachers, as well as the definition of the eight constructs and the relational hypotheses included. Finally, the possibilities of the model and future lines of research are discussed.","tags":["Artificial intelligence","Education","Teachers","Technology acceptance model","eLearning"],"title":"How to Measure Teachers' Acceptance of AI-driven Assessment in eLearning: A TAM-based Proposal","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1561593600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600708564,"objectID":"682d77e2ef270775ab1bbd6cd447139e","permalink":"https://cbjuan.github.io/talk/2019_intro_ai/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019_intro_ai/","section":"talk","summary":"(Talk in Spanish) Intro to Artificial Intelligence.

It is applied in many different contexts successfully. One of the contexts where Artificial Intelligence is applied is in Education. In the literature, we find several works in the last years that explore the application of Artificial Intelligence-related techniques to analyze students’ behavior, to enable virtual tutors or to assess the learning. However, what are the students’ perceptions on this subject of Artificial Intelligence and Education? Do they accept the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques to assess their learning? Are they reluctant to be influenced by non-human agents in such a human process like education? To try to respond to these questions, this paper presents a novel proposal of a research model based on the Technology Acceptance Model. To describe the model, we present its different main constructs and variables, as well as the hypotheses to analyze, adapted to the object of study. Finally, we discuss the main implications of this research model, the opportunities that could come based on this proposal and the future of this research.","tags":["Artificial intelligence","Technology acceptance model","Education","eLearning","Students"],"title":"Measuring Students’ Acceptance to AI-Driven Assessment in eLearning: Proposing a First TAM-Based Research Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Cruz-Benito","Francisco J.

Many studies include these approaches in different research areas: from research in healthcare to mobile environments, robotics, etc. Interaction is seen as a critical concept, and the work for its improvement is a crucial factor for many platforms, systems, and business domains. The goal of this manuscript is to present a systematic review of the literature to identify, analyze and classify the published approaches to support or enhance Human-Computer Interaction or Human-Machine Interaction from the perspective of software architectures. The method followed is the systematic review following the guidelines related to Systematic Literature Reviews methods such as the one proposed by Kitchenham and other authors in the field of software engineering. As results, this study identified 39 papers that included software architectures to improve or analyze Human-Computer Interaction or Human-Machine Interaction. Three main approaches were found on software architectures: layered architectures, modular architectures, and architectures based on software agents, but they lacked standardization and were mainly ad-hoc solutions. The primary interfaces covered were those related to Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and multimodal/natural ones. The primary application domain detected were in multimodal systems. The main purpose of most of the papers was to support multimodal interaction. Some conclusions achieved are that the generic solutions to support or analyze HCI/HMI processes are still rare in the literature. Despite many works dealing with this topic and its issues and challenges, it is necessary to keep on improving the research in this area through the application of standard techniques and solutions, exploring new ways of analyzing and interpreting interaction, escaping from ad-hoc solutions or evaluating the solutions proposed.","tags":["Human-Computer Interaction","Human-Machine Interaction","Software Architectures","Systematic Literature Review"],"title":"Analyzing the software architectures supporting HCI/HMI processes through a systematic review of the literature","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1554940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595931549,"objectID":"40a13e537e1dcdffda5fc860b34f8902","permalink":"https://cbjuan.github.io/talk/2019_se_usal_remote/","publishdate":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019_se_usal_remote/","section":"talk","summary":"(Talk in Spanish) Practical overview about what is working remotely and what to expect.

Despite that, they present an evident learning curve that could be hard for regular developers and newcomers in the field of quantum computing. On the other hand, currently there are many ways to build intelligent systems that can learn from humans and processes to build a knowledge corpus and provide a different kind of help to humans in tasks like aiding in decision making processes, recommending multimedia resources, building conversational agents, etc. In this paper we describe a work-in-progress project developed by the IBM Q team that implements an intelligent system based on a deep learning approach that learns how people code using the Open QASM language to later offer help and guidance to the coders by recommending different code sequences, logical steps or even small pieces of code. During the paper, we describe our current approach and first results. They include the use of seq2seq neural networks that effectively learn quantum-code sequences, and which will be tested in real context in the near future to improve the user experience in IBM Q Experience products.","tags":[],"title":"A Deep-Learning-Based Proposal to Aid Users in Quantum Computing Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1526428800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595930658,"objectID":"111dd4691a9b23200cc60c477743dd8c","permalink":"https://cbjuan.github.io/talk/2018_quantum_pintofscience/","publishdate":"2018-05-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018_quantum_pintofscience/","section":"talk","summary":"(Talk in Spanish) Outreach talk about Quantum Computing foundation and basic ideas in the context of the event Pint of Science 2018, Salamanca edition","tags":[],"title":"Computación cuántica. ¿humo, realidad o futuro? ¿Todo a la vez?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Juan Cruz-Benito","José Carlos Sanchez-Prieto","Andrea Vázquez-Ingelmo","Roberto Therón","Francisco J.

To test the effect of redirecting users between both versions of the web form, we used a group of users that already have started the questionnaire and redirect them to the other version; this is, we changed the web form version they use to the other version and measure how this change affects them.

Esto ha supuesto un nuevo impulso para afrontar las crecientes dificultades relacionadas con la inserción laboral de los titulados y los desajustes entre la formación recibida y los requisitos de los puestos de trabajo. En el nuevo paradigma educativo, las competencias se han convertido en la referencia a partir de la cual se organiza, planifica y evalúa el aprendizaje, y las agencias de calidad encargadas de evaluar los planes de estudio han introducido nuevos criterios ligados a la empleabilidad y la inserción laboral. Sin embargo, en España la información sobre muchos de estos temas es insuficiente, especialmente en cuanto a las competencias que se necesitan a lo largo de la vida laboral y la aportación de la universidad en su adquisición, los factores que determinan el acceso al empleo y la estabilidad laboral, la satisfacción con el trabajo y con la formación recibida, la idoneidad de las metodologías educativas utilizadas, o los desajustes entre la educación y el empleo. Con esta finalidad, en el año 2012 se creó el Observatorio de Empleabilidad y Empleo Universitarios. El objetivo de este artículo es la presentación de los resultados de esta iniciativa sistémica de política universitaria encaminada al seguimiento y a la medición de la empleabilidad y el empleo de los universitarios en España.","tags":["Universidades; Educación superior; Estudiantes universitarios; Empleabilidad; Empleo juvenil; Titulados universitarios; Capital humano; Competencias"],"title":"Empleabilidad de los titulados universitarios en España.

The objective of the research is to find common patterns, opinions, and behaviors between different people regarding the use of visual communication and people's state of visual literacy, while also considering the possible cultural differences related. To explain visual literacy and its implications, the theoretical background about the visual literacy research field is presented first. Then, also within the section on background, the chapter presents the main concepts related to culture, and how it and visual literacy can be analyzed together to enable cross-cultural analysis. To conduct these cross-cultural analyses, this chapter proposes a new kind of quantitative questionnaire-based instrument that includes a section to measure the cultural characteristics of the individual and their level of literacy. This instrument proposal is the main result, since the research field of visual literacy lacks this kind of quantitative approach.

Such adaptability is based on the application of machine-learning procedures and an A/B testing approach. To detect the user preferences, behavior, and the optimal version of the forms for all kinds of users, researchers built predictive models using machine-learning algorithms (trained with data from more than 3000 users who participated previously in the questionnaires), extracting the most relevant factors that describe the models, and clustering the users based on their similar characteristics and these factors. Based on these groups and their performance in the system, the researchers generated heuristic rules between the different versions of the web forms to guide users to the most adequate version (modifying the user interface and user experience) for them. To validate the approach and confirm the improvements, the authors tested these redirection rules on a group of more than 1000 users. The results with this cohort of users were better than those achieved without redirection rules at the initial stage. Besides these promising results, the paper proposes a future study that would enhance the process (or automate it) as well as push its application to other fields.","tags":["human factors","learning (artificial intelligence)","user interfaces","enabling adaptability","user characteristics detection","machine learning","original study","questionnaires","machine-learning procedures","A/B testing approach","user preferences","optimal version","predictive models","machine-learning algorithms","relevant factors","similar characteristics","different versions","adequate version","user interface","user experience","redirection rules","Web forms","user behavior","heuristic rules","Predictive models","Testing","Employment","Tools","Machine learning algorithms","Software","Electronic mail","Adaptability","machine learning","user profiles","web forms","clusters","hierarchical clustering","random forest","A/B testing","human-computer interaction","HCI"],"title":"Enabling Adaptability in Web Forms Based on User Characteristics Detection Through A/B Testing and Machine Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Vázquez-Ingelmo","Juan Cruz-Benito","Francisco J.

To manage these data flows, data-driven ecosystems need high levels of interoperability, as it allows the collaboration and independence of both internal and external components. REST APIs are a common solution to achieve interoperability, but sometimes they lack flexibility and performance. The arising of GraphQL APIs as a flexible, fast and stable protocol for data fetching makes it an interesting approach for data-intensive and complex data-driven (eco)systems. This paper outlines the GraphQL protocol and the benefits derived from its use, as well as it presents a case of study of the improvement experienced by the Observatory of Employment and Employability (also known as OEEU) ecosystem after including GraphQL as main API in several components. The results of the paper show promising improvements regarding the flexibility, maintainability and performance, among other benefits.","tags":null,"title":"Improving the OEEU's data-driven technological ecosystem's interoperability with GraphQL","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Interview"],"content":"","date":1499900400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600704624,"objectID":"d0079f4437d715961df8e9ba2825a5d2","permalink":"https://cbjuan.github.io/media/2017-tlp-innova/","publishdate":"2017-07-13T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/media/2017-tlp-innova/","section":"media","summary":"[ES] Interview published in the [TLP Tenerife's website](https://tlp-tenerife.com/) about my trajectory and the talk I was going to give in TLP Innova 2017","tags":["media"],"title":"Jul 13, 2017. \"La informática es un arma poderosa para enseñar a la gente\"","type":"media"},{"authors":["Juan Cruz-Benito","Francisco J.

In our case, the large survey is a questionnaire produced by the Spanish Observatory for University Employability and Employment (OEEU in the Spanish acronym). This questionnaire is composed by around 32 and 60 questions and between 86 and 181 variables to be measured. The research is based on the previous experience of a past questionnaire proposed by the OEEU composed also by a large amount of questions and variables to be measured (63–92 questions and 176–279 variables). After analyzing the target population of the questionnaire (with the target population of the previous questionnaire as reference) and reviewing the literature, we have designed 11 proposals for changes in the questionnaire that could improve users’ completion and success ratios (changes that could improve the users’ trust in the questionnaire, the questionnaire usability and user experience or the users’ engagement to the questionnaire). These changes are planned to be applied in the questionnaire in two main different experiments based on A/B test methodologies that will allow researchers to measure the effect of the changes in different populations and in an incremental way. The proposed changes have been assessed by five experts through an evaluation questionnaire. In this questionnaire, researchers gathered the score of each expert regarding to the pertinence, relevance and clarity of each change proposed. Regarding the results of this evaluation questionnaire, the reviewers fully supported 8 out of the 11 changes proposals, so they could be introduced in the questionnaire with no variation. On the other hand, 3 of the proposed changes or improvements are not fully supported by the experts (they have not received a score in the top first quartile of the 1–7 Likert scale). These changes will not be discarded immediately, because despite they have not received a Q1 score, they received a score within the second quartile, so could be reviewed to be enhanced to fit the OEEU’s context.","tags":null,"title":"Improving success/completion ratio in large surveys: a proposal based on usability and engagement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Cruz-Benito"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1478563200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544725048,"objectID":"d88163dd2788ac07801616f8ca5fd104","permalink":"https://cbjuan.github.io/publication/2016_juancruz-benito/","publishdate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_juancruz-benito/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Systematic Literature Review \u0026 Mapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco J.

This is very costly and unusual in universities. Virtual 3D worlds allow simulating immersive professional contexts for training. The first aim of this project is to design and construct a virtual analytical laboratory adapted to good laboratory practices (GLP) in the Second Lifetexttrademark (SL) virtual world. The second aim is to set up a practice based on the inspection of the virtual laboratory installations. Finally, the students' acquisition of knowledge and satisfaction were assessed. The laboratory is available online on the Usalpharma Island of SL. The installations, equipment and tools were created using SL's building tools. During two academic years, a total of 30 students made an inspection of the laboratory to identify and classify nonconformities of a GLP quality system (supplementary video). They report the results in an assessment report. The following evaluation of the practice shows that the scores concerning the assessment of skills (7.1 textpm 0.5 out of 10) and knowledge acquired (7.8 textpm 0.3 out of 10) met the expectations of the authors. In an anonymous questionnaire, 81 % of the students assessed the experiment as satisfactory. The virtual laboratory allows, at very low cost, training postgraduate students in facilities not available at university. Tools like this could be implemented not only at universities, but in professional field in order to assess competencies or support the essential lifelong learning of the laboratory staff.","tags":null,"title":"Facility-based inspection training in a virtual 3D laboratory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco J.
