      <description>&lt;p&gt;🚀 Thrilled to have been part of Metafuturo 2025 as a keynote speaker!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the incredible opportunity to share insights on the convergence of Quantum Computing + AI at this forward-thinking event organized by Bizkaiko Foru Aldundia / Diputación Foral de Bizkaia and ATRESMEDIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intersection of quantum technologies and artificial intelligence represents one of the most exciting frontiers in tech today. During my talk, I shared what we are doing in this field at IBM Quantum. From LLMs and agentic AI applications for quantum computing to AI-optimized quantum circuits, we&amp;rsquo;re witnessing the birth of computational capabilities that seemed like science fiction just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What struck me most during the event was the genuine curiosity and engagement from attendees across diverse industries. The talks and panels ranged from practical implementations to philosophical implications—exactly the kind of multidisciplinary dialogue we need as we navigate this quantum journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to the organizers for creating such a vibrant platform for discussing the technologies that will shape our tomorrow. Events like Metafuturo 2025 are essential for building bridges between cutting-edge research and real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future is quantum-enhanced, AI-powered, and closer than we think! 🔬⚡&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Returning to the University of Salamanca: Sharing My PhD Journey</title>
      <link>https://cbjuan.github.io/post/2025-university-salamanca-phd-talk/</link>

      <guid>https://cbjuan.github.io/post/2025-university-salamanca-phd-talk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a special day returning to my alma mater, the University of Salamanca to share my journey with current PhD students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about my PhD experience and the career path that followed felt like coming full circle. It was inspiring to connect with brilliant doctoral candidates who are navigating their own research journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main message? Make the most of your PhD years - they&amp;rsquo;re not just about the research, but about developing the critical thinking, resilience, and problem-solving skills that will serve you throughout your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy and curiosity of the audience brought back memories of my own PhD days, which were truly an adventure. Getting to hang out with fellow PhD students and other speakers made the experience even more enriching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A heartfelt thank you to Universidad de Salamanca, the Escuela de Doctorado and Alicia G. for the invitation and for creating such valuable spaces for knowledge sharing and mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s to supporting the next generation of researchers! 🎓&lt;/p&gt;
