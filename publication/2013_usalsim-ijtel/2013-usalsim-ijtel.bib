 abstract = {USALSIM is a project developed by the University of Salamanca as a response to the policy changes of learning and work placements in the new European Space for Higher Education, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education and inscribed within an innovation programme regarding the employability of university students (CAIE059). The contribution of USALSIM is concerned with how to face the increase in the number of students who will participate in the different university work placement programmes and the increasing number of companies and institutions necessary to host and train these students. This project uses a 3D virtual environment (a work placement simulator) that creates a virtual representation of different work environments and allows students to acquire professional skills. Representing a professional workspace such as a laboratory, for example, the student can simulate common tasks through active learning. This virtual world is focused on a constructive pedagogy, whereby students are directly involved in their formative development, establishing professional relationships, developing transversal and technical competencies, and evaluating their knowledge.},
