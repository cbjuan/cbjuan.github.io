 abstract = {This research paper presents a software architecture based on services and deployed in a cloud environment that retrieves, analyzes and presents information collected from a closed eLearning environment like the Virtual Worlds. This software architecture is able to gather the user interaction in the digital platform, organize the interaction data and to perform measurements, estimates and basic analysis of the data, in order to give information to the managers and teachers about usage indicators and the resolution degree of the goals that students need to achieve in these scenarios and learning systems. To test this idea, the paper describe the application of the analytics layer of this software architecture on a real case, so it is possible to understand how can help this kind of architectures in the detection of the achievement of the learning goals or in the knowledge discover about users usage within the learning environment.},
