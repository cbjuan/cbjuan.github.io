 abstract = {This paper presents a Literature Review on software architectures that support Human-Computer Interaction analysis processes. Despite of software architectures and Human-Computer interaction are not new research fields; there are not much scientific papers that cover the relation of both (at least in the Web of Science and Scopus databases used). The Literature Review presented covers the relationship between both fields, conducting the research using 3 questions proposed by the authors in order to discover the current state of art of this software architectures that supports HCI, to research about the different trends in the field of software engineering that help in the design, definition and exploitation of them and to find out if there is in the literature an application to the field of eLearning of these software complex systems that deal with HCI analysis. Regarding the results of the Literature Review, authors pre-sent a classification of the papers reviewed by 24 common features discovered, helping the readers and others researchers to know how these software architectures work with different kind of HCI analysis approaches, how are designed, what are the goals of applying this kind of system for the analysis, or what are the application contexts.},
